The Surface Water Balance Estimation Tool (SBAT) is a software tool for the computation of baseflow time series, recession coeffients and reach-based water balances within river networks. SBAT is implemented in Python 3.9, it is object oriented with an focus on multiple complex river networks with tributaries and water diversions. It provides modules to combine time series analysis capabilities with geospatial processing routines to find out relationships between the gauge hydrographs, the river network and the corresponding river basins. SBAT is developed by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources [BGR].
